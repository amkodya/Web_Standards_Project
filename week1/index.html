		<h2>HEADER:</h2>
		<img src="images/header.jpg">
			<p>This is an example of header that I like from rareview.com. I like this header because it has the fixed bar at the top that maintains the logo and main nav links. Also I like headers of main pages that bring you into the site with a nice, crisp graphic. The target audience are clients that need a web design made. The client needs a functional and innovative design to give their company edge and bring their presentation and image to the next level. The design is all black and white except for the graphic. As I stated earlier, the fixed navbar at the top provides the user with ease of use as they don’t have to school around the page searching for the links they need to get their task accomplished. I like that the font at least appears to be the same throughout and is all sans-serif. The font, its sizing and tracking are very appropriate to keep the typography clean. The typography doesn’t fight its background image which is important.</p>

		<h2>CALL TO ACTION:</h2>
		<img src="images/cta.png">
			<p>These call to action examples are some typical examples for what likes look some type of Apple related product. The target audience is people who have iPhones or iPads that are also customers of this online store. The client needs a button that is easy to find that directs them to important locations such as a checkout point, app download location, etc. I like the fact that these are a typical call the action design. As we learned usability lessons, people like familiar and will not know what to do if they come across an object they do not recognize. These call to action examples actually look like buttons you can press in as implied by the gradients and therefore the user will know what to do with it. Also, the call to actions contain glyphs and simplified text to express where the call to action is taking you. The typography is sans-serif which doesn’t make it look to busy and gives a web 2.0 look. </p>

		<h2>FEATURES:</h2> 
		<img src="images/features.png">
			<p>When listing your pages features you want to draw the user in without immediately bombarding them with information. The features example I chose is from theecologycenter.com. As you can see here, there is a flat icons with simple descriptive heading and a small block of information underneath. The target audience is someone who is looking at the benefits of being ecologically friendly. The client needs an organized way to find information on how to help the ecosystem. The design entices the user with a subtle evening sizzed glyphs contained in evening sized containers. Once the user looks at the glyph, they will recognized the shape that will represent what they are about to read about and will be met with the title for the logo and information they’re about to read. Once the user has found an icon and title they want to read about, then their eyes can zoom on the information below. Not a lot of people would be interested in reading if all the text was just sitting there in front of you like your standard book and designer really took the time to consider how proximity would play into how willingly and easily the user would be able to locate and absorb the information. The typography is works well as the titles stand out from the body text and the body text is small but spaced enough as to not deter the reader. Also the color scheme relates to subject as it an Earthy palette.</p>


		<h2>ABOUT:</h2>
		<img src="images/about.png">
			<p>The designers behind http://wearefo.com/ aka fragileobscurity have take your average “About Me” page and brought it to a new innovative, level. Whenever you reach an about me page, you’re usually faced with a big block of text under the a bold-faced name. FO have used the “picture says 1000 words” method to represent themselves. As you can see, we are actually looking into the “eyes” of the designers of the page. The pictures are the biggest item on the page and I believe they are trying to make a statement about who they are via their style and poses. Along with the portraits, we’re given their names, titles and links to their personal various social media account. Social media gives the user insight about what the user is doing real-time which I think carries more worth than a block of text noting what the designer has done in the past. The names are in bold face and sans-serif making them more prevalent at first glance than the other text. The lesser important information is given a style that gives the page a little personality. The lesser important text is given a italicized and decorative font and visual hierarchy suggest it is less important than the designers name but also should be dually noted. The design works well and provides the user with a to-the-point solutions to the About Me section.</p>

		<h2>BLOG:</h2>
		<img src="images/blog.png">
			<p>CreativeDepart.com presents a blog-type solution to its page design.  The audience is looking to read the blog posts of this website which give information and promotes articles that are based on various design topics. The clients goal is to browse these article in a way that makes sense either subject wise or chronologically. I like the CreativeDepart take on blog design, which is a series of tiles and widget looking boxes. This is more interesting than your standard vertical stack and allows the user to bounce around the page without having to scroll. The tiles are of flat design, that allow information that is being provided on the tile, to stand out. Also the fact that the boxes are minimal color, it makes the individual images that relate to the blog posts, stand out that much more, draw the user in and increase the likelihood that they will read the individual posts.</p>

		<h2>CONTACT:</h2>
		<img src="images/contact.png">
			<p>The contact us page I have chosen is builtbybuffalo.com and it shows us a simple design that solves the contact us design problem in a simple and useful way. The target audience is a visitor or builtbybuffalo.com and wants to find information on how to contact the company. The user can click the contact us button on the global navigation bar and instantly gain the information. Coming from working in an environment where I deal with customers and technology, I realize the people want to find contact information quickly and easily. Users become discouraged and disinterested if they can’t contact someone in a company. This solution brought to us by builtbybuffalo.com present the user with simple glyphs that visually inform us of the contact information were about to receive. The glyph/icons are simple but also organize the information in a visually pleasing manner. The color treatment of the icons is subtle but still capture the attention, which leads the user to the information. Next, the label of the information we’re about to receive is thin and red in color. This typography treatment is meant to capture attention so as to have the users eye travel from the icon to label then to the actual information being sought out. From my experience in my job, I see people struggle with technology daily therefore this “contact us” design would be extremely useful and convenient for those users (and actually all users).</p>

		<h2>LOGIN/REGISTRATION:</h2>
		<img src="images/login.jpg">
			<p>The example I chose for Login/Registration is from Joost.com. This example is pretty typical but includes some key features that I personally think are mandatory for today’s modern web user. The target audience would be someone signing up for Joost, which I believe is a dating website. The client’s goal is to register for the Joost account so they can utilize all of its features. I personally am not a huge fan of registration forms and I prefer as less keystrokes as possible. This login form includes something that every login form should have: a Connect with Facebook button. This simple button pulls your information directly from Facebook, making it so that its not only linked to your social media but also reduced the amount of information you have to fill out to register. Having to fill out a long registration form is a deterrent and makes users not want to sign-up for your website. This registration form allows you to sign-up formally but doesn’t make you fill out too many lines in order to fully register. All the lines in the form are in the same page with the SIGN ME UP! Call the action at the button, indicating you’re all one after you fill these few lines out. Its almost as if the website is on the same page, so-to-speak, as the user, recognizing the users lack of patience for sign-up forms. The form is a simple color scheme and simple typography which makes the user more inclined to participate in your website by signing up.</p>

		<h2>FOOTER:</h2>
		<img src="images/footer.jpg">
			<p>When dealing with a footer, I think its better to go simple and clean than anything. The footer is usually find a map, if you will, that will take you to the different and possibly obscure location you want to find on the website. This footer is from Stitchlabs.com and provides us with an example of a simple and typical footer design. Its important for the user to recognize how to finding these links and the information they provide. As I stated in a previous section, if the user has a hard time finding what they’re looking for, they will go elsewhere. In this footer design, like most, we see a title of the group of links. This helps the user quickly glance across the row to figure out which list they need to look under to find the link they need. Once they find the title that relates to the link, the can look underneath it to find specific link. The typography is handled in such a way where the titles of the groups of has visually hierarchy applied via the use of bold-face. The user, like I stated, will first look at the title and it needs to grab their attention first. The entire footer is subtle and doesn’t try to steal the attention away from the rest of page almost as if its stating “hey, I’m down here whenever you need me!”</p>
